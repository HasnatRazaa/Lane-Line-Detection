🔰 Project 1: Lane Line Detection for Autonomous Driving
GitHub Repo: HasnatRazaa/Lane-Line-Detection
---

📝 Description
This project implements a Lane Line Detection System for autonomous driving vehicles using traditional computer vision techniques. It identifies lane boundaries in video frames, ensuring that the vehicle stays safely within its lane. Designed for submission as part of an internship task for ITSOLERA.
